    <p>Is anyone else a fan of barbecues and cookouts solely for all of the side dishes?! I can’t get enough of the pasta salad, broccoli salad, potato salad, and even deviled eggs! For me, the side dishes are the star of the show! And I am pleased to report this healthy macaroni salad turned out SO good. It’s rich, and creamy, with the perfect amount of tang from the dressing and crunch from the veggies.</p>

    <p>This will be your new favorite side dish to make during the summer! It goes great with burgers, chicken sausage, or grilled chicken. It is also a great dish to make ahead of time and only takes 15 minutes to prep!</p>


    <h2>Ingredients needed</h2>

    <p>There are a lot of different ways to make a macaroni salad, but this way is pretty classic, with no crazy ingredients, just simple and delicious flavors! Here’s everything you’ll need:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pasta</strong>  – Use your favorite type of pasta! I am using gluten-free brown rice elbow noodles but you can also try a lentil or bean pasta for the extra protein or go with a more traditional macaroni</li>
        <li>Vegetables – Red onion, celery, bell pepper (use red, yellow, and/or orange), and gherkins pickles are added for crunch!</li>
        <li>Hard-boiledd <strong>egg</strong> – Many macaroni salad recipes don’t include eggs, but I love the texture (and added protein!) they add to the salad.</li>
        <li><strong>Mayonnaise & Greek yogurt</strong> – I love using a combination of mayonnaise and Greek yogurt as the base of the dressing. If preferred, you can use all mayo or all Greek yogurt.</li>
        <li><strong>Red wine vinegar</strong> – You can also use white wine vinegar or apple cider vinegar.</li>
        <li><strong>Honey</strong> – Just a teaspoon! I find this little bit is enough to round out the flavors of the dressing.</li>
        <li><strong>Dijon Mustard</strong> – For a subtle spiciness that pairs well with the other flavors.</li>
        <li><strong>Garlic</strong> – Because don’t ALL dishes need a little garlic?</li>
        <li><strong>Salt & pepper</strong> – To bring all of the flavors together.</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>How to make this recipe</h2>

    <p>Macaroni salad is one of the easiest recipes to toss together. The most time-consuming part about making this side dish is cutting up all the vegetables.</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Boil pasta.</strong> Cook macaroni according to package instructions until al dente. Drain well and drizzle with a teaspoon of extra virgin olive oil so the noodles don’t stick together.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine salad ingredients.</strong> In a large bowl, combine macaroni, red onion, celery, bell pepper, pickles, and eggs. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Make dressing. In a spouted cup or medium bowl, combine mayo, Greek yogurt, red wine vinegar, honey, dijon mustard, garlic, salt, and pepper. Whisk until well combined.</li>
        <li>Assemble. Pour the dressing over the macaroni salad and gently toss until everything is well combined. Enjoy immediately or cover and chill until ready to serve.</li>
    </ol>
