    <h2>Notes</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Tapioca flour is a natural thickener.  If you don’t have any on hand, you can sub in cornstarch or arrowroot.</li>
        <li>You can prepare this crisp ahead of time and store it in the fridge for up to 24 hours.  Once ready to bake, bring to room temperature before baking.</li>
        <li>This crisp is delicious when served warm with vanilla ice-cream.  If you want to keep the recipe 100% vegan, be sure to buy dairy-free ice-cream.</li>
